# Assignment 4
This includes two programs that are designed for each activity. They are named Activity 1 and Activity 2 respectively. 


## Description
- Activity1: This program includes a single-threader server and a multi-threaded server. This also has 2 versions, one that allows for the threads to grow unbounded and another that specifies the number of clients allowed. This program runs as a Client-Server interface where the 3 different tasks are the servers that can be ran for each task and the client is the same one used to run all 3 tasks. The client of the program is given 6 options when runnning the program. They are able to add a string to the list, remove an item/string from the list, display all of the items that are currently in the list, retrieve the number of elements that are in the list, reversing the string so that it is a reversal of the original string entered, and finally quitting the program.

- Activity2: This program is a game that uses the protobuf as protocol. The game is simple because all it does is remove tiles from an image. The game works as a battleship board that uses 3 different possible boards each time the game is played one of them is randomly chosen to be played. All the player has to do is hit all of targets to win the game. The game works using a client and server interface. The given protobuf files are used to implement the game. The user is also ale to see the leaderboard and whenever they win they add a win to their name on the leaderboard.
